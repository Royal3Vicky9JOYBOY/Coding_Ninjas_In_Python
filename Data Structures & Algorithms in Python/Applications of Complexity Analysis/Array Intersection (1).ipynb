    "Send Feedback\n",
    "You have been given two integer arrays/list(ARR1 and ARR2) of size N and M, respectively. You need to print their intersection; An intersection for this problem can be defined when both the arrays/lists contain a particular value or to put it in other words, when there is a common value that exists in both the arrays/lists.\n",

    "The first line of each test case or query contains an integer 'N' representing the size of the first array/list.\n",

    "The third line contains an integer 'M' representing the size of the second array/list.\n",

    "Since, both input arrays have two '2's, the intersection of the arrays also have two '2's. The first '2' of first array matches with the first '2' of the second array. Similarly, the second '2' of the first array matches with the second '2' if the second array."
